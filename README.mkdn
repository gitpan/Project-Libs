# NAME

Project::Libs - Add module directories of a project into @INC
automatically

# SYNOPSIS

    # the simplest way
    use Project::Libs;

    # add more other dirs into @INC
    use Project::Libs lib_dirs => [qw(extlib vendor)];

    # add more other marks locate on a project root
    use Project::Libs project_root_files => [qw(README Changes)];

# DESCRIPTION

Project::Libs automatically adds directories that may contain modules
which a project depends on.

Imagin there's such a project as below: CPAN-standard file arrangement
and using git as a SCM (`modules' directory contains git submodules
and that's written in `.gitmodules').

    |_ PROJECT_ROOT
       |_ .git
       |_ .gitmodules
       |_ Makefile.PL
       |_ lib/
       |_ t/
          |_ lib/
          |_ compile.t
          |_ basic.t
       |_ script/
          |_ server.pl
          |_ create.pl
       |_ extlib/
       |_ modules/
          |_ Foo
             |_ lib/
          |_ Bar
             |_ lib/
          |_ ...

You may bother writing such code as below in all the script located in
t/*, script/*, or other to add module path into @INC.

    use FindBin;
    use lib "$FindBin::Bin/../lib";
    use lib glob "$FindBin::Bin/../modules/*/lib";

To `use Project::Libs' helps you doing that.

In this case, after loading this module, the directories below are
added into @INC:

- * lib

- * extlib

- * t/lib

- * modules/Foo/lib

- * modules/Bar/lib
